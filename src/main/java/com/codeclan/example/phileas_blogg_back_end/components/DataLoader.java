        Review review1 = new Review(afghanistan.getName(), edmund, "Bad First Impressions, but we thoroughly enjoyed our time", "We went for our honeymoon and managed to get a great deal on flights and an all inclusive resort for 10 days. However the problems started arising when we first arrived at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, we waited over 2 hours for a cab. When we finally got one, the vehicle was in a terrible condition, there was a constant rattling coming from the engine for the entirety of the 40 minute journey. When we arrived at our destination the cab driver then charged us double what the lonely planet guide book has said it would be, however there was no way to dispute it since the cab didn't have a meter. We were also thoroughly disappointed by our first impressions of the state of the hotel, the front wall on the left hand side was completely caved in, we later found out it was from an airstrike carried out by the Americans. The lobby was also in disrepair, but the staff were very pleasant and were very helpful in taking our luggage up to our room. Now for the room, it was nothing special, but it was well furnished with a large bath and even had a hair dryer. The highlight of the trip was definitely the food, they served up these kebabs with this sort of pitta bread, although it was a little spicy for the misses, the were filled to the brim with flavour and much better than we get at home in Watford. Looking back on the trip, we did enjoy our time despite our initial impressions and the bombing run on the 3rd night, however if given the chance again to visit for as good a deal as we got, we'd take it in a heartbeat, 3 stars", "2019-10-10", 4);

We were not shown the room, just told 'Your room is upstairs', we spent almost the whole 5 minutes trying to find the room, to which we came across some horrifying scenes that you couldn't joke about. The lock on the room door had been smashed off at some point and a dodgy repair done, which left around a 1-2inch gap between the door and frame while closed! The place smelled, there was clearly drugs being taken and used from the address (May we add, this place also takes DSS claimants whom are claiming Housing Benefit) The guesthouse shouldn't be serving any food, following a investigation by Bristol City Council a while ago, however, upon entering the hallway it clearly states 'Breakfast in bed Â£3.50'. The lady whom 'greeted' us wasn't very friendly, and was quick to take our money. I could go on but take it from us, this truly is the house of horrors and you really won't get any sleep here. avoid and sit on a bench somewhere, as going here is likely to give you nightmares if not food posioning. I recommend anyone who has stayed here to contact Bristol City Council, request to speak to Food safety team or the Anti social behaviour unit, as they are fully aware and would love to hear from you.", "2012-01-14", 1);
